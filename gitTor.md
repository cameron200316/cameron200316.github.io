## Project Overview
GitTor is an open-source alternative to large hosting platforms such as GitHub and GitLab. Using P2P connections and BitTorrent protocols, GitTor does not use a centralized server for storing repositories. The repositories are shared between peers. This removes the reliance on major servers that are prone to outages and also decentralizes your data.

## My Contributions
My time on the project was focused on the CLI(command line interface) portion of the project. I served as the team lead for the CLI, and as one of the major components of GitTor, I was involved in the decision-making process for both the CLI and the WebApp, as they needed to work together. 

## Experience Gained
The most valuable experience was working on an entire project lifecycle from proposal to final presentations and demos. This experience is not feasible in most classes, and even in professional settings, where project lifecycles are typically multiple years.

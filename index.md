## Welcome
This portfolio is an accumulation of my four years at Iowa State University. The portfolio is meant to showcase the experience I have gained through my college experience, both inside and outside the classroom. 

There are several sections list as such:
* My Career - Describing my professional experiences outside of the classroom
* GitTor - My Senior Design Project
* My Projects - Showcasing my proudest projects during my time at college
* Documents - Important documents like my resume

I hope you enjoy looking over my professional portfolio
